# NOTE: redis-data-pvc is NO LONGER NEEDED
# Redis now uses emptyDir for temporary cache/session storage
# as recommended by the company. Auth tokens are stored in Redis with TTL.
# You can delete this PVC after migration:
#   kubectl delete pvc redis-data-pvc -n uoulu
#
# apiVersion: v1
# kind: PersistentVolumeClaim
# metadata:
#   name: redis-data-pvc
#   namespace: uoulu
# spec:
#   accessModes:
#     - ReadWriteOnce
#   resources:
#     requests:
#       storage: 5Gi
