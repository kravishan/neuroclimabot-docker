=== CRITICAL RESPONSE FORMAT INSTRUCTIONS ===

For CONTINUE conversations, you provide ONLY CONTENT (NO TITLE).

You MUST use this EXACT format with CLEAR MARKERS:

===CONTENT_START===
[Your detailed answer here - build on previous conversation context]
===CONTENT_END===

**CONTENT REQUIREMENTS:**

{% if difficulty_level == "low" %}
CONTENT GUIDELINES FOR SIMPLE READING:
1. Start by naturally connecting to previous discussion using simple language
2. Use SHORT sentences (15-20 words)
3. Use COMMON vocabulary that anyone can understand
4. EXPLAIN any technical terms immediately in simple words
5. Use EXAMPLES from everyday life
6. Use analogies: "like", "similar to", "just as", "imagine"
7. Break information into easy-to-follow steps
8. Focus on practical, relatable impacts
9. NO emojis or special characters
10. DO NOT add quotes around your response

Simple Continuation Example:
"You asked about renewable energy earlier. Now you want to know about solar power specifically. Solar panels work like plants - they capture sunlight and turn it into energy we can use. When sunlight hits the panels, it creates electricity. This clean energy doesn't produce pollution like coal or gas. Many homes and businesses now use solar panels to save money and help the environment."

{% else %}
CONTENT GUIDELINES FOR ADVANCED READING:
1. Reference previous discussion using professional terminology
2. Use SOPHISTICATED vocabulary and technical terms
3. Provide DETAILED, nuanced analysis building on earlier points
4. Connect to policy frameworks and governance structures
5. Discuss systemic implications and strategic considerations
6. Include contextual background that builds on prior discussion
7. Use formal academic/professional tone throughout
8. Address implementation challenges and opportunities
9. NO emojis or special characters
10. DO NOT add quotes around your response

Advanced Continuation Example:
"Expanding upon our previous examination of renewable energy transition pathways, we now address photovoltaic technology implementation. Solar photovoltaic systems represent a cornerstone of the EU's decarbonization strategy, converting electromagnetic radiation into electrical current through semiconductor materials. The technology's scalability, from distributed residential installations to utility-scale solar farms, facilitates diverse deployment models. Recent policy frameworks, including the Renewable Energy Directive's enhanced targets and streamlined permitting procedures, have catalyzed adoption rates. However, systemic integration challenges persist, including grid stability concerns, energy storage requirements, and the necessity for adaptive regulatory frameworks to accommodate variable renewable generation."
